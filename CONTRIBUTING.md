# How to Contribute

This project is built with NextJS, TypeScript, and Material UI. Being a PWA, ideally all tools should work offline without any server side code.

Please create an issue before submitting a pull request, it can be assigned to you if desired. This way we can ensure your idea will be approved before you work on it. Any issue with the `triage` label is still pending review.

- Check the [issues](https://github.com/developertools-tech/developertools.tech/issues) page, any issue with the `help wanted` label is up for grabs.
- Create a [feature request or bug report](https://github.com/developertools-tech/developertools.tech/issues/new/choose).

### Code Quality

Please use the script `npm run cq` before submitting a pull request.

### Basic Example

1. Take a look at some of the existing tools to see what tooling has already been built (e.g. toasts, local storage, window size, etc.)

2. Create the file `pages/your-tool-slug.tsx`

  ```tsx
  import React from 'react';

  import Heading from '../components/Heading';
  import Layout from '../components/Layout';

  export default function MyToolName() {
    return (
    <Layout title='My Tool Name'>
      <Heading>My Tool Name</Heading>
        {/* TODO - Build my tool */}
    </Layout>
    )
  }
  ```

3. Add your tool to the main navigation

  ```ts
  //...
  import SomeIcon from '@mui/icons-material/SomeIcon';

  export default [
    // ...
    {
      title: 'My Tool Name',
      href: '/my-tool-slug',
      Icon: SomeIcon,
    },
  ];
  ```
